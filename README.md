# Resume
Project was made using CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap.
I Decided to make a resume web version for a project to showcase the new skills I have been learning!
This is my first time ever using a framework so it took some getting use to.
Generally, I have only been working with just HTML and CSS to create things.
I worked diligently to learn Bootstrap and now I feel comfortable with it now.
