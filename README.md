# Resume
Project was made using CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap.
Decided to make a resume web version for a project to show my knowledge of what I have been learning!
This is my first time using learning a framework, chose Bootstrap.
Generally I have bee working with just HTML and CSS.
I worked really hard to learn Bootstrap and now I feel comfortable with it now.
